Rustian was a school project where I have rewritten the core of a Minecraft Java 1.15.2
Server completely in Rust using the Actor Model to utilize the full potential of a modern
CPU. **This project needs OpenSSL to work.**

This specific version of this project will not be continued because I learned Rust with
it (the code works but does not look that great), though I might rewrite it at some point
to be more modular and to use more "idiomatic" code that would have a better readability.

I am going to link to the rewritten version here if I decide to make one. If you are
interested in collaborating, please tell me. :green_heart:
